# Darts scoreboard
Python program that automates scoring and tracks player averages in a game of 501 darts.  
Built as a personal project to practice programming skills, logical problem-solving, and apply maths in code.  


## Features
- Supports two players in a game of 501.
- Calculates and displays each player's running score.
- Tracks and outputs average scores per player.
- Detects invalid throws (overshooting zero).
- Declares the winner automatically.
## How to Run


Example output:
Game of 501 Darts Alice vs Bob
Alice Score = 421 | Average = 80.0
Bob Score = 460  | Average = 41.0
...
Game Over! Winner is Alice

## Future Improvements
- Add input validation and error handling for a smoother user experience.  
- Develop a simple GUI (Tkinter or PyQt) for more user-friendly interaction.  
- Export results to a CSV file for saving match history.  
- Extend to multiplayer games.  
- **Embedded Systems Extension:** Adapt the project to run on an ESP32 microcontroller, displaying the scoreboard on a TFT screen. This will involve rewriting the program in C++/MicroPython and integrating hardware control, bringing the project closer to real-world embedded design.
